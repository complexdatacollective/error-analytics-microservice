title: Creating a User Account
date: 13th March 2024
---

To use Fresco, you need to set up an administrator account which will enable you to access the protected parts of the app for study management. Only one administrator account can be created.

<TipBox danger>

For security, you have **_30 minutes_** from when the app is deployed to create a user account. If this time elapses without a user account being created, your configuration will expire. To redeploy, follow our guide to [reset your database](../troubleshooting#instance-expired---reset-your-database).

</TipBox>

## Create an account

Visit your deployed app and enter a username and password.

<TipBox>

Only **one** user account can be created in Fresco. If you need access for multiple team members, we reccomend using a shared username and password for the administrator account to ensure that your team can access the platform.

</TipBox>

<TipBox danger>

If you forget your password, you **will not be able to reset it**. We reccomend keeping a record of your username and password in a secure location.

## Upload a protocol

You can optionally upload a protocol. Protocols can also be uploaded from the [Protocols page](../features#protocol-management) once the setup steps are completed.
