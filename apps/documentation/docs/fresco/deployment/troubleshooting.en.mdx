"Invalid API Key" error during Vercel deployment
</h2>

You may encounter an error in your deployment such as "Invalid API Key", or "API keys must start with...".

</summary>


This error means that you provided an incorrect environment variable. Make sure to enter the environment variable value correctly. You must enter the value that starts after `=` symbol
(e.g: `UPLOADTHING_APP_ID=5q5ybg9dwg`, here `UPLOADTHING_APP_ID` is the key of variable and `5q5ybg9dwg` is the value. You should always enter the value.)

When completing the initial setup for Fresco, you have 30 minutes to complete the process. If you exceed this time, you will be redirected to a page that informs you that your instance has expired. If this happens, you must delete your database and create a new one.

To delete your database:

1. Navigate to your database on the dashboard by selecting _Storage_ and then selecting your database.
