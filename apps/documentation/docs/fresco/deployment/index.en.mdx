Deploying Fresco involves setting up your own unique version of the project, known as an **instance**. This approach allows you to manage your own data and customize the infrastructure to suit your needs. 

The deployment process involves a number of steps, including forking the [Fresco repository](https://github.com/complexdatacollective/Fresco) and configuring databases and infrastructure. The [deployment guide](./deployment/guide) will walk you through the process of deploying your own instance of Fresco.

Deploying Fresco can be achieved entirely for free using the free tiers of each service, but you may upgrade your own infrastructure as needed. Consult the [cloud pricing](./deployment/cloud-pricing) page for more information.

As new versions of Fresco are released, you can upgrade your instance to the latest version by following the [upgrade guide](./deployment/upgrading).

Should you run into any issues, please consult the [troubleshooting](./troubleshooting) guide or reach out on the [user community](https://community.networkcanvas.com).
