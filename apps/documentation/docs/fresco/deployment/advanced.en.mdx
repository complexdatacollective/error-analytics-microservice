<SummarySection>

For most users, the default [deployment process](./guide) will be sufficient. However, if your circumstances require using different cloud infrastructure or a VPS, you can do so by using [Docker](https://www.docker.com/).

</SummarySection>

<PrerequisitesSection>

This guide is intended for advanced users who are already familiar with Docker and cloud infrastructure. It provides a high-level overview of the steps required to deploy Fresco using Docker, but does not provide detailed instructions for each step.

If you are not already familiar with these technologies, we recommend following our [default deployment guide](./guide).

## Finding Hosting Services

For advanced deployment, you will need to find a cloud service or VPS provider that supports Docker. Here are a few options:

- [Digial Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/)
- [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/)
- Your own VPS

## Set up Docker Environment

Ensure that you have Docker installed on your server. You can follow the instructions on the [official Docker website](https://docs.docker.com/install/).

## Prepare Fresco Repository

Clone the [Fresco repository](https://github.com/complexdatacollective/Fresco) to your server. You can do this by running the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/complexdatacollective/Fresco.git
```

## Setup Database Infrastructure

Configure your database infrastructure. You can use a managed database service or set up your own database server.

## Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root of the Fresco repository. You can use the [`.env.example`](https://github.com/complexdatacollective/Fresco/blob/main/.env.example) file as a template.

## Build Docker Image

Run the following command to build the Docker image using the [`Dockerfile`](https://github.com/complexdatacollective/Fresco/blob/main/Dockerfile) in the root of the Fresco repository:

```bash
docker build -t fresco .
```

## Run Docker Container

Run your Docker container.

## Access Fresco

You can now access Fresco by visiting the url that you have configured in your hosting service.

## Next Steps

After deploying your Fresco instance, you will need to create an administrator account by following the steps in the [Creating a User Account](./create-user-account) guide.

<TipBox danger>

For security, you have **_30 minutes_** from when the app is deployed to create a user account. If this time elapses without a user account being created, your configuration will expire. To redeploy, follow our guide to [reset your database](../troubleshooting#instance-expired---reset-your-database).
