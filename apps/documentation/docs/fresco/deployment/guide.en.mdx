<SummarySection>
This guide will walk you through the process of deploying your instance of Fresco, including forking the repository, setting up database infrastructure, and deploying to the web.

</SummarySection>

<PrerequisitesSection>
Before you get started, you should:

- Read the [about Fresco](/en/fresco) article to understand what Fresco is and how it works.
- Read about the deployment process in our [deployment overview](/en/fresco/deployment) article.
- Create an account on [GitHub](https://github.com/) if you do not already have one.

</PrerequisitesSection>
</SummaryCard>

## Step 1: Create an app on UploadThing

Fresco uses your UploadThing account to store media files including protocol assets.

1. Go to <a href="https://uploadthing.com" target="_blank">uploadthing.com</a>.

2. Click **"Get started"**.

   ![Select "Get Started"](/assets/img/fresco-images/uploadthing1.png)

3. Sign in with Github.

   ![Sign In with GitHub](/assets/img/fresco-images/uploadthing2.png)

4. Authorize UploadThing by clicking **"Authorize pingdotgg"**.

   ![Authorize pingdotgg](/assets/img/fresco-images/uploadthing3.png)

5. You will be prompted to navigate to your dashboard. From the dashboard Click **"Create a new app"**.

   ![Create a new app](/assets/img/fresco-images/uploadthing4.png)

6. Give your app a name and click **"Create App"**.

   ![Create app](/assets/img/fresco-images/uploadthing5.png)

7. From your dashboard, navigate to the **"API Keys"** section from the sidebar and copy your API keys.

<TipBox>

Save your API keys in a safe place as they are required to deploy Fresco on Vercel.

</TipBox>

![Copy your API keys](/assets/img/fresco-images/uploadthing6.png)

For more information about UploadThing, check out <a href="https://docs.uploadthing.com" target="_blank">UploadThing Docs</a>.

For information about cloud pricing, read our [cloud pricing](./cloud-pricing) documentation.

## Step 2: Fork Fresco Repository

1. On the [Fresco repository](https://github.com/complexdatacollective/Fresco), click **"Fork"**.

   ![Fork repository](/assets/img/fresco-images/github-fork1.png)

2. Create your Fork

   Enter a repository name (this will be your Fresco instance name), description (optional), and click **"Create Fork"**.
   ![Create fork](/assets/img/fresco-images/github-fork2.png)

This will create a separate instance of the Fresco repository that you can deploy.

## Step 3: Deploy Forked Repository on Vercel

Sign in to Vercel via your Github account credentials so that you can easily connect your repositories. You can use their "Hobby" tier or paid plan. For more information about cloud pricing, read our [cloud pricing](./cloud-pricing) documentation.

1. <a href="https://vercel.com/new" target="_blank">
     Create a new Project
   </a>

2. Import Git Repository

   Find your Fresco instance from the list of your git repositories and click **"Import"**.
   ![Import Git Repository](/assets/img/fresco-images/vercel2.png)

3. Configure Environment Variables.

   Copy the template below and paste it into the Environment Variables section in Vercel to prepopulate the form with the required environment variables.

   Replace the values with your environment variable values from UploadThing you copied in [Step 1](#step-1-create-an-app-on-uploadthing)

   > UPLOADTHING_SECRET=your_uploadthing_api_key\
   > UPLOADTHING_APP_ID=your_uploadthing_app_id\
   > DISABLE_ANALYTICS=false

   | Variable Key           | Description                                                                                                                                                          |
   | ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
   | **UPLOADTHING_SECRET** | The API key for your UploadThing app. This is used to authenticate requests from Fresco to the UploadThing API.                                                      |
   | **UPLOADTHING_APP_ID** | The unique identifier for your UploadThing app. This is used along with the secret key to identify your app when making requests from Fresco to the UploadThing API. |
   | **DISABLE_ANALYTICS**  | A flag to disable the analytics microservice for Fresco. If this is set to `false`, the analytics microservice will be enabled.                                      |

<TipBox>

We use analytics to gather error data from instances of Fresco to troubleshoot issues. By leaving `DISABLE_ANALYTICS` set to `false` (the default) you will help us identify bugs and improve the app.

   </TipBox>

![Configure Environment Variables and Deploy](/assets/img/fresco-images/vercel-configure.png)

<TipBox danger>

When entering the environment variables, do not include the variable keys in the inputs (e.g: `UPLOADTHING_SECRET=`). You should enter the value of the variable which starts after `=` symbol (e.g: `sk_live_xxxx`)

   </TipBox>

<TipBox danger>

When providing the environment variables, do not enclose the variable values in quotes. For example:

✅ Correct:
`sk_live_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx`

❌ Incorrect:
`'sk_live_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx'`

   </TipBox>

4. Deploy

   Click **"Deploy"** and wait for the deployment to finish.

<TipBox>

If you encounter any issues during deployment, check out the [Troubleshooting](../troubleshooting) article or our <a href="https://community.networkcanvas.com/">User Community</a> for a possible solution.

</TipBox>

## Step 4: Create your database

1. From your project dashboard, select **"Storage"**. Then, select **Create** within the Postgres row.
   ![Create a Postgres database](/assets/img/fresco-images/vercel-db-1.png)

2. Review and accept the terms in the modal.
   ![Accept terms](/assets/img/fresco-images/vercel-db-2.png)

3. Give your database a name and select the region that is closest to where you and your participants will be located. Then, click **"Create"**. Your database will be generated and you will be redirected to the Getting Started page.

   ![Enter a name and create the database](/assets/img/fresco-images/vercel-db-3.png)

4. You will be prompted to connect your project. Select **"Connect"**.

   ![Connect database to your project](/assets/img/fresco-images/vercel-db-4.png)

5. Select the **"Deployments"** tab. Click on the menu beside the most recent deployment and select **"Redeploy"**. This will redeploy your project with your new connected database.

   ![Redeploy app](/assets/img/fresco-images/vercel-db-5.png)

## Step 5: Visit your deployed app

Visit your deployed Fresco app by clicking on the preview or go to your dashboard by clicking **"Continue to Dashboard"**.

![Continue to dashboard](/assets/img/fresco-images/vercel3.png)

Then, click on one of the domain names or the **"Visit"** button.

![Visit domain](/assets/img/fresco-images/vercel4.png)

## Next Steps

After deploying your Fresco instance, you will need to create an administrator account by following the steps in the [Creating a User Account](./create-user-account) guide.

<TipBox danger>

To ensure the security of your deployment, you have **30 minutes** from when the app is deployed to create a user account. If this time elapses without a user account being created, your configuration will expire. To redeploy, follow our guide to [reset your database](../troubleshooting#instance-expired---reset-your-database).
