Using Fresco will be a familiar experience for anyone who has used the desktop applications. This guide will walk you through the basic workflow for using Fresco to conduct your study.

Freso is a web-based platform for conducting network studies. It is designed to be used in conjunction with the Network Canvas desktop applications, Architect and EgoWeb. Fresco allows you to upload protocols created in Architect, add participants to your study, and monitor the progress of your study as participants complete their interviews.

## Basic Workflow with Fresco

Using Fresco will be familiar to anyone who has used the desktop applications, with the significant advantage that now all management of protocols, participants, and data can be conducted through a web-based dashboard.

The basic workflow for using Fresco is as follows:

1. **Deploy Fresco**: Deploy your own instance of Fresco (more on this in the [deployment guide](/en/fresco/deployment/guide)). 
2. **Upload Protocols**: Upload one or more Network Canvas protocols created in Architect to Fresco.
3. **Add Participants**: Add participants to your study, either individually or in bulk. Alternatively, use the anonymous recruitment feature to allow participants to self-enroll in the study.
4. **Conduct Interviews**: Share either the unique participant URL or the anonymous recruitment URL with participants to allow them to complete the interview on their own device.
5. **Monitor Progress**: Monitor the progress of your study using the dashboard.
6. **Export Data**: Export data from the interviews page, once your data collection is complete.

Considerations around hosting. Security, IRB, privacy, etc. Your university may be able to host a compliant version of Fresco for you.

## Uploading Protocols

How to do it. Should I upload loads? One for each study?

## Adding Participants

Setting up participants. Bulk upload. Anonymous recruitment. Limit interviews setting.
