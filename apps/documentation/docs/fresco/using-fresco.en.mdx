This guide will walk you through the basic workflow for using Fresco to conduct your study.

Fresco is designed to be used in conjunction with Architect for designing interview protocols. If you haven't already, you should [design your protocol in Architect](/en/desktop/tutorials/building-a-protocol) before proceeding.

## Basic Workflow

Using Fresco will be familiar to anyone who has used the desktop applications, with the significant advantage that now all management of protocols, participants, and data can be conducted through a web-based dashboard.

The basic workflow for using Fresco is as follows:

1. **Deploy Fresco**: Deploy your own instance of Fresco (more on this in the [deployment guide](/en/fresco/deployment/guide)). 
2. **Upload Protocols**: Upload one or more Network Canvas protocols created in Architect to Fresco.
3. **Add Participants**: Add participants to your study, either individually or in bulk. Alternatively, use the anonymous recruitment feature to allow participants to self-enroll in the study.
4. **Conduct Interviews**: Share either the unique participant URL or the anonymous recruitment URL with participants to allow them to complete the interview on their own device.
5. **Monitor Progress**: Monitor the progress of your study using the dashboard.
6. **Export Data**: Export data from the interviews page, once your data collection is complete.

We will now walk through each of these steps in more detail.

## Deployment

Fresco is designed to be deployed on your own server(s) and infrastructure. This is to ensure that you have full control over the data collected in your study, and to ensure that you can comply with any relevant data protection regulations or IRB requirements that you may have.

For many researchers, using our [basic deployment guide](/en/fresco/deployment/guide) to deploy to the free Vercel hobby plan will be sufficient. However, if you have specific requirements around data security, privacy, or compliance, you may need to deploy Fresco to your own server, or to specialist services.

If you are unable to deploy Fresco yourself, your university may be able to host a compliant version of Fresco for you. Please contact your IT department or research support office for more information, and refer them to our [advanced deployment guide](/en/fresco/deployment/advanced) for more information on the requirements for hosting Fresco.

## Uploading Protocols

Once you have deployed Fresco and have access to your dashboard, we can begin by uploading one or more protocols for your study.

If you have not yet designed your protocol in Architect, you should do so before proceeding. You can find a guide to designing a protocol in Architect [here](/en/desktop/tutorials/building-a-protocol).

</TipBox>

In Fresco you can upload as many protocols as you would like (within the resource limits of your hosting). This allows you to have multiple protocols for different studies, or to have multiple versions of the same protocol for different groups of participants.

However, we recommend **not** hosting different studies on the same instance of Fresco, as this can lead to confusion and potential data leakage. If you are conducting multiple studies, our suggestion is that you deploy a separate instance of Fresco for each study.

### To upload a protocol

1. Navigate to the `Protocols` page in the dashboard.
2. Click the `Upload Protocol` button.
3. Select the `.netcanvas` file that you exported from Architect.
4. Click `Upload`.

Your protocol will then be validated and uploaded to Fresco. If it contains any assets (images, audio, video, or network files) these will be uploaded to the UploadThing service and linked to your protocol.

Once the process is finished, you will see your protocol listed on the `Protocols` page. You can click on the protocol to view its details, and to see the unique URL that you will share with participants to conduct interviews.
