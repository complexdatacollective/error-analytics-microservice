<Paragraph variant="lead">
Fresco is an exciting new pilot project that brings Network Canvas interviews to the web browser. 
</Paragraph>

It allows you to take any existing Network Canvas protocol file, upload it to a web-based dashboard, and then share a URL with participants to allow them to complete the interview in their own time, on their own device.

Although Fresco does
not add new features to Network Canvas, it provides an entirely new way to conduct interviews using
your existing Network Canvas protocols.

## Jump straight In

If you would like to jump straight in and try Fresco, you can visit the [Fresco Sandbox](/en/fresco/sandbox) to explore the features of Fresco without needing to deploy it on your own.

Otherwise, you can read on to learn more about the features and functionality of Fresco, and how it differs from the desktop applications.

## What is Fresco?

We see Fresco as a way to make conducting Network Canvas interviews more accessible, and to provide
researchers with more flexibility in how they conduct their studies. We heard throughout the development
of the desktop applications that researchers wanted to be able to conduct interviews remotely, and these
calls were only amplified by the COVID-19 pandemic. 

We also found that many researchers struggled with the workflow of the desktop applications, and
in particular with managing protocol deployment and the aggregation of data. 

Fresco is our response to these challenges. 

We also see Fresco as a milestone in the development of Network Canvas Studio, which will be a web-based
platform for designing and conducting interviews that we hope to complete in the coming years.

## Features and Functionality

Fresco includes features to support participant management, protocol management, and data export. It is
also designed to be 100% compatible with all existing Network Canvas protocols. Below you can find a
brief overview of the features and functionality of Fresco.

<TipBox>

Although there are no new features added to the interview experience, there are some [restrictions and omissions](./about#known-limitations) to existing functionality.

</TipBox>



### Protocol Management

You can upload Network Canvas protocols created in Architect on the **Protocols** page. This page also provides an overview of all protocols uploaded to the study.

If [anonymous recruitment](#anonymous-recruitment) is enabled, you can also generate a unique onboarding URL for each protocol. These URLs can be shared with participants to allow them to self-enroll in your study.

### Participant Management

The **Participants** page allows you to manage participants in the study.

<KeyConcept>

#### Adding Participants

You can add new participants to the study indiviudally, or in bulk by uploading a CSV file. Your CSV file can contain the following columns:

- **identifier** - must be a unique string, and should not be easy to guess. Used to generate the onboarding URL to allow integration with other survey tools.
- **label** - can be any text or number. Used to provide a human readable label for the participant.

Either an _identifier_ column or a _label_ column **must be provided** for each participant. The _identifier_ and _label_ columns **must be lowercase**.

</KeyConcept>

You can also view the status of each participant's interview, and generate a unique participation URL for a selected participant and protocol. These URLs can be shared with participants to allow them to self-enroll in your study.

Participants and participation URLs can also be exported in bulk.

### Data Export

Data can be managed and exported from the **Interview** page. This page provides an overview of all interviews in the study, and allows you to export data with a variety of export options which are identical to those found in Interviewer.

![Data Export Options](/assets/img/fresco-images/features/data-export.png)

You can also export a CSV of incomplete URLs from the **Interview** page. This can be useful for sending reminders to participants who have not yet completed their interview.

### Settings and Configuration

The **Settings** page allows you to configure your instance of Fresco.

#### Anonymous Recruitment

If enabled, participants can self-enroll in the study using a unique onboarding URL. This URL can be generated for each protocol, and shared with participants.

#### Limit Interviews

If this option is enabled, each participant will only be able to submit a single completed interview for each protocol (although they may have multiple incomplete interviews). Once an interview has been completed, attempting to start a new interview or to resume any other in-progress interview, will be prevented.

![Settings Page](/assets/img/fresco-images/features/settings.png)

### Onboarding Methods

There are two distinct methods for onboarding participants in your study. They may be used independently, or in combination.

#### Unique Participant URLs

A unique URL can be generated for each participant per protocol from the [Participants page](#participant-management). This URL can be shared with participants to allow them to self-enroll in your study. You can also generate these URLs in bulk. This method is useful for studies where you have a pre-existing list of participants, or where you are using an external survey tool to recruit participants.

These URLs will be in the format:

```bash
https://{your-deployment-url}/onboard/{protocolId}/?participantIdentifier={participantIdentifier}
```

#### Anonymous Participation URLs

If [anonymous recruitment](#anonymous-recruitment) is enabled, participants can self-enroll in the study using a unique onboarding URL. This URL can be generated for each protocol on the [Protocols page](#protocol-management), and shared with participants. Any participant who has the URL can complete an interview, and will be given the label "Anonymous Participant" and a generated unique identifier.

These URLs will be in the format:

```bash
https://{your-deployment-url}/onboard/{protocolId}/
```

## Key differences between Fresco and the Desktop apps

There are several key differences between Fresco and the desktop applications that you should be aware of:

- Fresco is a web-based platform for administering Network Canvas interviews. It is not a replacement for the desktop applications, but rather a new way to conduct interviews. Fresco works with all existing Network Canvas protocols, and does not add new features to Network Canvas.
- In Fresco, **interviews are completed in a browser** by visiting a URL. This means that interviews can be conducted remotely, and participants can use their own devices to complete the interview. **Note that mobile phones are not supported!**
- **Interview management is also conducted in the browser** via a researcher facing dashboard. Protocols, participants, interviews, and settings configuration can all be managed through the browser interface.
- **Fresco stores all data in a database**. This means that data is stored on a server on the internet, rather than on a local computer. This has implications for data security and privacy, and means that you will need to consider the legal and ethical implications of using Fresco.
- You are responsible for **hosting and maintaining Fresco** on your own servers. This means that you will need to have some technical knowledge to deploy and maintain Fresco.
- Fresco is **a pilot project** and does not yet support all of the features of the desktop apps. For example, custom node label workers are not implemented, and videos and audio cannot autoplay on first load due to browser limitations. For a full list of known issues, see the [Known Limitations](#known-limitations) section below.

## Getting Started

<TipBox danger>

Fresco is in beta and is not yet recommended for use in critical research studies. We encourage users to test Fresco in non-critical environments, and are actively seeking feedback from users to help us improve it.

</TipBox>

To explore Fresco and learn how to use it, we recommend you start with the following resources:

- [Features and Functionality](/en/fresco/features) - This article will introduce you to the way that Fresco works, and will describe the features and functionality that are available.
- [Deployment Guide](/en/fresco/deployment/guide) - To learn how to deploy Fresco for your own studies, read about the deployment process and follow the [Deployment Guide](/en/fresco/deployment/guide/).
- [Fresco Sandbox](/en/fresco/sandbox) - A shared example environment where you can explore the features of Fresco without needing to deploy it on your own.

Should you encounter issues, we encourage you to use the search function at the top of each page, read our [FAQ](/en/fresco/faq), or visit our [community forum](https://community.networkcanvas.com) for support.

## Known Limitations

Because of the nature of the web platform, some features from Interviewer could not be implemented. These include:

- [Custom node label workers](/en/desktop/advanced-topics/node-labelling#custom-node-labelling-advanced) are not implemented. This would have posed a potential security risk, so we made the decision not to implement them. If you were using this feature and need help with an alternative, please contact us.
- Videos and audio on your information screens cannot autoplay on first load due to browser limitations. Participants must have interacted with the interview before media can autoplay.
- The 'Use fullscreen forms' visual preference is not supported. This preference was useful for devices that have large software keyboards, such as tablets. However, Fresco is designed to be used on a desktop or laptop computer, and so this preference is not necessary.
- The interaction sounds feature introduced in the last release of Interviewer has not been brought over to Fresco yet.
- When exporting data, the "use screen layout coordinates" feature uses a hardcoded screen size of 1920 x 1080. Please note that this does not correspond to the screen size used by your participants. This change was neccesary because the screen size can no longer be assumed to be static throughout the interview.
