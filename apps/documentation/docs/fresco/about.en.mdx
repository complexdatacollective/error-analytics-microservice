The Fresco project aims to bring Network Canvas interviews to the web browser. It is a pilot project that does not
add new features to Network Canvas, but rather provides a new way to conduct interviews.

<KeyConcept>

### Fresco is a web-based platform for administering Network Canvas interviews

In Fresco, **interviews are completed in a browser**. This means that interviews can be conducted remotely, and participants can use their own devices to complete the interview.

**Interview management is also conducted in the browser**. Protocols, participants, interviews, and settings configuration can all be managed through the browser interface.

For information about supported devices and browsers for participants and study administrators, see the [FAQ.](/en/fresco/faq)

## Getting Started

To explore Fresco and learn how to use it, we recommend you start with the following resources:
- [Fresco Sandbox](/en/fresco/sandbox) - A shared example environment where you can explore the features of Fresco without needing to deploy it on your own.
- **Deployment** - To learn how to deploy Fresco for your own studies, read about the [Deployment Process](/en/fresco/deployment/) and follow the [Deployment Guide](/en/fresco/deployment/guide/).
- **Features and Functionality** - To learn about the features and functionality of Fresco, see the [Features](/en/fresco/features) documentaiton.

Should you encounter issues, we encourage you to use the search function at the top of each page, read our [FAQ](/en/fresco/faq), or visit our [community forum](https://community.networkcanvas.com) for support.

## Known Issues

- Custom node label workers are not implemented.
- Videos and audio cannot autoplay on first load due to browser limitations. Participants must have interacted with the interview before media can autoplay.
- The 'Use fullscreen forms' visual preference is not supported.
- When exporting data, the "use screen layout coordinates" feature uses a hardcoded screen size of 1920 x 1080. Please note that this does not correspond to the screen size used by your participants.
