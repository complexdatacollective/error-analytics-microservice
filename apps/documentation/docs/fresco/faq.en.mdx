### Where will announcements about releases be posted?

New versions of Fresco will be announced on our <a href="https://community.networkcanvas.com/" target="_blank">User Community</a>. More information about the upgrade process can be found in the [Upgrade Guide](./deployment/upgrading).

### Which browsers are supported?

Fresco is supported on latest version of Chrome, Safari, and Firefox. This applies to the backend user dashboard and the participant interview experience.

### Which devices and platforms are supported for participants?

Participants can use any computer or tablet with a supported browser for interviews. Smartphones or small-screen devices are not compatible. Tablets should be used in landscape mode for optimal viewing during interviews.

### How do I create another user account for my colleague?

Only one user account can be created in Fresco. If you need to share access with a colleague, you can share your login credentials with them. We reccomend using a shared username and password for the administrator account to ensure that your team can access the platform.

### How do I reset my password?

You cannot reset your password in Fresco. Please make sure to keep your login credentials so that you do not lose access to the platform.

<TipBox danger>

If you have lost your login credentials, you will be required to [reset your database](/en/fresco/troubleshooting#instance-expired---reset-your-database). This will result in the loss of all data and unexported interviews.
