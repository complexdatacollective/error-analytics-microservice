## How much does Fresco cost?

Fresco is free and open source software. You can always 
download the latest version of Fresco source-code from the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/complexdatacollective/fresco).

We have done our best to make sure that you can deploy Fresco on your own server (if you have one)
without any additional costs. However, you may need to pay for server hosting, depending on your needs.

We have provided a [Deployment Guide](./deployment) to help you get started with deploying Fresco
using the hobby (free) tier of a cloud platform called Vercel. Information about the costs of using Vercel can be found on their [pricing page](https://vercel.com/pricing).

## What are the requirements for deploying Fresco?

Fresco is a web application that requires a server to host it. You can deploy Fresco on your own server or use a cloud platform like Vercel. The [Deployment Guide](./deployment) provides detailed instructions on how to deploy Fresco on Vercel, for free.

The core technology stack for Fresco is as follows:
  - Frontend: Next.js (React)
  - Backend:
    - Node 20+ - for running the backend server
    - Next.js API routes - for handling API requests
    - tRPC - for defining and handling API routes
    - PostgreSQL - for storing all data
    - Prisma - for interacting with the database
    - UploadThing - for storing protocol assets

To deploy Fresco, you will need to have access to one or more servers that can run these technologies. For example you might have a server that runs the Next.js frontend and another server that runs the PostgreSQL database.

Advanced users can refer to the [advanced deployment guide](./deployment/advanced) for more information on deploying Fresco on their own server.

## Where will announcements about releases be posted?

New versions of Fresco will be announced on our <a href="https://community.networkcanvas.com/" target="_blank">User Community</a>. More information about the upgrade process can be found in the [Upgrade Guide](./deployment/upgrading).

## Which browsers are supported?

Fresco is supported on latest version of Chrome, Safari, and Firefox. This applies to the backend user dashboard and the participant interview experience.

## Which devices and platforms are supported for participants?

Participants can use any computer or tablet with a supported browser for interviews. Smartphones or small-screen devices are not compatible. Tablets should be used in landscape mode for optimal viewing during interviews.

## How do I create another user account for my colleague?

Only one user account can be created in Fresco. If you need to share access with a colleague, you can share your login credentials with them. We reccomend using a shared username and password for the administrator account to ensure that your team can access the platform.

## How do I reset my password?

You cannot reset your password in Fresco. Please make sure to keep your login credentials so that you do not lose access to the platform.

<TipBox danger>

If you have lost your login credentials, you will be required to [reset your database](/en/fresco/troubleshooting#instance-expired---reset-your-database). This will result in the loss of all data and unexported interviews.
