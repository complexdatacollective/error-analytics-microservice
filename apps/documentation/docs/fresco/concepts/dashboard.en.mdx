Fresco includes a "dashboard", which is the main researcher-facing portion of the app. It can always be accessed by visiting the root URL of your Fresco deployment, and requires a login to access.

The dashboard provides an overview of your instance of Fresco, including the number of protocols, participants, and interviews. It also provides quick links to manage these aspects of the study on their own dedicated pages.

Finally, the dashboard shows a real-time activity feed, which provides a log of all significant activity that has taken place in your instance of Fresco. This includes when participants start and complete interviews, and when protocols are uploaded or deleted. It also includes any data exports.
