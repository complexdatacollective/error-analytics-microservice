There are two distinct methods for onboarding participants in your study. They may be used independently, or in combination.

#### Unique Participant URLs

A unique URL can be generated for each participant per protocol from the [participants page](#participant-management). This URL can be shared with participants to allow them to self-enroll in your study. You can also generate these URLs in bulk. This method is useful for studies where you have a pre-existing list of participants, or where you are using an external survey tool to recruit participants.

These URLs will be in the format:

```bash
https://{your-deployment-url}/onboard/{protocolId}/?participantIdentifier={participantIdentifier}
```

#### Anonymous Participation URLs

If [anonymous recruitment](#anonymous-recruitment) is enabled, participants can self-enroll in the study using a unique onboarding URL. This URL can be generated for each protocol on the [protocols page](#protocol-management), and shared with participants. Any participant who has the URL can complete an interview, and will be given the label "Anonymous Participant" and a generated unique identifier.

These URLs will be in the format:

```bash
https://{your-deployment-url}/onboard/{protocolId}/
```


#### Limit Interviews

If this option is enabled, each participant will only be able to submit a single completed interview for each protocol (although they may have multiple incomplete interviews). Once an interview has been completed, attempting to start a new interview or to resume any other in-progress interview, will be prevented.
