The Fresco project aims to bring Network Canvas interviews to the web browser. It is a pilot project that does not
add new features to Network Canvas, but rather provides a new way to conduct interviews.

Though there are no new features added to the interview experience, there are a few [known issues](./about).

Additionally, there are some differences in how studies are managed. **This article outlines the new features and functionality for study management in Fresco**.

## Dashboard

The main dashboard provides an overview of all activity within the study. It is the first page you see when you log in to the application.

## Protocol Management

You can upload Network Canvas protocols created in Architect on the **Protocols** page. This page also provides an overview of all protocols uploaded to the study.

If [anonymous recruitment](#anonymous-recruitment) is enabled, you can also generate a unique onboarding URL for each protocol. These URLs can be shared with participants to allow them to self-enroll in your study.

## Participant Management

The **Participants** page allows you to manage participants in the study.

### Adding Participants

You can add new participants to the study indiviudally, or in bulk by uploading a CSV file. Your CSV file can contain the following columns:

- **identifier** - must be a unique string, and should not be easy to guess. Used to generate the onboarding URL to allow integration with other survey tools.
- **label** - can be any text or number. Used to provide a human readable label for the participant.

Either an _identifier_ column or a _label_ column **must be provided** for each participant. The _identifier_ and _label_ columns **must be lowercase**.

</KeyConcept>

You can also view the status of each participant's interview, and generate a unique participation URL for a selected participant and protocol. These URLs can be shared with participants to allow them to self-enroll in your study.

Participants and participation URLs can also be exported in bulk.

## Data Export

Data can be managed and exported from the **Interview** page. This page provides an overview of all interviews in the study, and allows you to export data with a variety of export options which are identical to those found in Interviewer. You can read more about the data export file types [here](/en/desktop/tutorials/using-server#file-type).

You can also export a CSV of incomplete URLs from the **Interview** page. This can be useful for sending reminders to participants who have not yet completed their interview.

## Settings and Configuration

The **Settings** page allows you to configure your instance of Fresco.

### Anonymous Recruitment

If enabled, participants can self-enroll in the study using a unique onboarding URL. This URL can be generated for each protocol, and shared with participants.

### Limit Interviews

If this option is enabled, each participant will only be able to submit a single completed interview for each protocol (although they may have multiple incomplete interviews). Once an interview has been completed, attempting to start a new interview or to resume any other in-progress interview, will be prevented.

## Onboarding Methods

There are two distinct methods for onboarding participants in your study. They may be used independently, or in combination.

### Unique Participant URLs

A unique URL can be generated for each participant per protocol from the [Participants page](#participant-management). This URL can be shared with participants to allow them to self-enroll in your study. You can also generate these URLs in bulk. This method is useful for studies where you have a pre-existing list of participants, or where you are using an external survey tool to recruit participants.

These URLs will be in the format:

```bash
https://{your-deployment-url}/onboard/{protocolId}/?participantIdentifier={participantIdentifier}
```

### Anonymous Participation URLs

If [anonymous recruitment](#anonymous-recruitment) is enabled, participants can self-enroll in the study using a unique onboarding URL. This URL can be generated for each protocol on the [Protocols page](#protocol-management), and shared with participants. Any participant who has the URL can complete an interview, and will be given the label "Anonymous Participant" and a generated unique identifier.

These URLs will be in the format:

```bash
https://{your-deployment-url}/onboard/{protocolId}/
```
