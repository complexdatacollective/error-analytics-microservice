The Fresco project aims to bring Network Canvas interviews to the web browser. It is a pilot project that does not
add new features to Network Canvas, but rather provides a new way to conduct interviews.

Though there are no new features added to the interview experience, there are some differences in how studies are managed. This document outlines the Fresco-specific features and functionality for study management.

## Dashboard

The main dashboard provides an overview of all activity within the study. It is the first page you see when you log in to the application.

## Protocol Management

You can upload Network Canvas protocols created in Architect on the **Protocols** page. This page also provides an overview of all protocols uploaded to the study.

If [anonymous recruitment](#anonymous-recruitment) is enabled, you can also generate a unique onboarding URL for each protocol. These URLs can be shared with participants to allow them to self-enroll in your study.

## Participant Management

The **Participants** page allows you to manage participants in the study.

You can add new participants to the study indiviudally, or in bulk by uploading a CSV file. Your CSV file can contain the following columns:

- **identifier** - must be a unique string, and should not be easy to guess. Used to generate the onboarding URL to allow integration with other survey tools.
- **label** - can be any text or number. Used to provide a human readable label for the participant.

<TipBox>
Either an identifier column or a label column must be provided for each participant. The identifier and label columns must be lowercase.
</TipBox>

You can also view the status of each participant's interview, and generate a unique participation url for a selected participant and protocol. These URLs can be shared with participants to allow them to self-enroll in your study.

Participants and participation URLs can also be exported in bulk.

## Data Export
Data can be managed and exported from the **Interview** page. This page provides an overview of all interviews in the study, and allows you to export data with a variety of export options.

You can also export a CSV of incomplete URLs from the **Interview** page. This can be useful for sending reminders to participants who have not yet completed their interview.

## Settings and Configuration
The **Settings** page allows you to configure your instance of Fresco.

### Anonymous Recruitment
If enabled, participants can self-enroll in the study using a unique onboarding URL. This URL can be generated for each protocol, and shared with participants.

### Limit interviews
If this option is enabled, each participant will only be able to submit a single completed interview for each protocol (although they may have multiple incomplete interviews). Once an interview has been completed, attempting to start a new interview or to resume any other in-progress interview, will be prevented.
