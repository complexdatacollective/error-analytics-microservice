This error means that you provided an incorrect environment variable. Make sure to enter the environment variable value correctly. You must enter the value that starts after `=` symbol
(e.g: `UPLOADTHING_APP_ID=5q5ybg9dwg`, here `UPLOADTHING_APP_ID` is the key of variable and `5q5ybg9dwg` is the value. You should always enter the value.)

## Instance Expired - Reset your Database

If your instance expires, you must delete your database and create a new one.

1. Navigate to your database on the dashboard by selecting _Storage_ and then selecting your database.
