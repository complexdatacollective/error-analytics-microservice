  It means that you provided an incorrect environment variable. Make sure to enter the environment variable value correctly. You must enter the value that starts after `=` symbol
  (e.g: `UPLOADTHING_APP_ID=5q5ybg9dwg`, here `UPLOADTHING_APP_ID` is the key of variable and `5q5ybg9dwg` is the value. You should always enter the value)
