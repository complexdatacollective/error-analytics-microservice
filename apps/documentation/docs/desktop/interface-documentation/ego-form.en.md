</InterfaceSummary>

The Ego Form is an interface that collects data on your participant (ego). When using the Ego Form, participants complete a [form](../key-concepts/forms) about themselves that consists of one or more fields. This Interface also contains an embedded introductory panel where the purpose of the form can be described to a participant.

## Configuring Ego Form

The configurable [form](../key-concepts/forms) determines which variables will be assigned to the ego section of the network.
