The Network Canvas project began with the development of a suite of desktop and tablet tools. These tools are still very much supported, although active feature development has concluded. Please visit the pages in this section to learn how the tools work, and how to implement your own study using Network Canvas.

## Getting Started

To get started using the Network Canvas desktop tools, [read the project overview](/en/desktop/project-information/project-overview), and [download the latest versions of the software](https://networkcanvas.com/download). We then suggest you explore the tutorial section, beginning with [using Interviewer](/en/desktop/tutorials/using-interviewer).

We encourage you to use the search function at the top of each page to find articles on any given topic. Our pages are heavily interlinked, and information is necessarily spread around.

## Useful Pages

Please explore the pages and headings to the left. Aside from some top-level pages (such as the Project Overview and the Installation Guide), the bulk of our documentation is under the following headings:

- **Getting Started** - which contains articles that cover essential basic information, such as how to install the software.
- **Tutorials** - where you will find in-depth articles that take you through the most fundamental tasks you can accomplish with the software, such as building a protocol, running it in Interviewer, and exporting data.
- **Project Information** - contains details of the origins of the projects, as well as information about security, IRB, and collaborating with our projects.
- **Advanced Topics** - contains articles that may be useful for advanced users or developers looking to implement new features.
- **Interface Documentation** - if you are looking for specific information about the configuration options of an interface, this section contains a page dedicated to each type.
- **Key Concepts** - which has self-contained articles on all the fundamental concepts within the Network Canvas software.
